UpGrad Lead Scoring Case Study (Sandhya/Malaika)
Problem Statement:
X Education offers online courses to industry professionals but is experiencing poor lead conversion rates. Out of an average of 100 leads per day, only about 30 are converted. The goal is to make the lead conversion process more efficient by identifying 'Hot Leads'â€”the most potential leads that could improve conversion rates and optimize the sales team's efforts.

Business Objective:
The primary objective is to identify the most promising leads, develop a model that can accurately score leads, and deploy this model for ongoing use.
